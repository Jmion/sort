# SORT

Sort uses the React framework to build a PWA (progressive web app). If you are not familiar with React please read up on the subject before continuing. Knowing the basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript is also required to be able to understand what has been done in this project. 

## Motivation
We decided to make a progressive web app since it allows for good usability in areas where internet conection is spoty. It is for this reason that we chose to use React to build our website. Bootstrap is being used to build a reactive design that will allow the website to look good on any device size. We want SORT to work on any device from a small cell phone to a huge computer screen.

## Getting started

Our main website component is calles *index.js* within this JS we render our single object which is situated in *App.js*. It is within *App.js* that most of the code for the webiste resides.
